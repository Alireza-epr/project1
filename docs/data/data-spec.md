# Data Specifications

## Sensor
After comparing various sensors, Sentinel-2 L2A was selected due to its free availability, moderate revisit time, and sufficient spatial resolution for vegetation monitoring.

## Index and bands
The project uses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess vegetation health, Calculated as:
```js
NDVI = (NIR-Red) / (NIR+Red)
```
NDVI values range from -1 to +1, with higher values indicating healthier vegetation.

For Sentinel-2 L2A, Band 8 (NIR) and Band 4 (Red) are used.
Band 8A (20 m) may serve as an alternative NIR source.

| **Band Name**    | **Description**                                       | **Resolution** |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| B4 - 640–670 nm  | Red                                                   | 10 meters      |
| B8 - 785–900 nm  | Near Infrared (NIR)                                   | 10 meters      |
| B8A - 855–875 nm | Narrow NIR (alternative for NIR, more specific range) | 20 meters      |

So, for NDVI calculation:
```js
NDVI = (B8-B4) / (B8+B4)
```
or sometimes:
```js
NDVI = (B8A-B4) / (B8A+B4)
```
Note: Band 8A (20 m) can be used as an alternative NIR band for higher spectral precision, especially in areas with mixed vegetation, while Band 8 (10 m) is sufficient for standard NDVI calculations.

## Cloud Strategy
Product QA Layer is used for cloud masking. 
Reasons for choosing QA Layer:
 - High accuracy using satellite algorithms
 - Fast and easy to implement
 - Consistent masking across all images

Sentinel-2 L2A provides a built-in QA layer to identify clouds, shadows, water, and clear pixels, ensuring accurate NDVI calculations.
This ensures that only clear pixels are used for vegetation analysis, improving reliability.

### Masking (Cloud, Shadow, Water) with SCL

We use the Sentinel-2 L2A `SCL` (Scene Classification Layer) asset to filter out invalid pixels.  
This raster contains one class code per pixel: clouds, shadows, snow, vegetation, water, etc.

Masked classes:
|  Value | Class Name               | Meaning                             |
| -----: | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
|  **0** | NO_DATA                  | Invalid data / outside image        |
|  **1** | SATURATED_OR_DEFECTIVE   | Sensor saturated or defective pixel |
|  **2** | DARK_FEATURES            | Shadows or very dark surfaces       |
|  **3** | CLOUD_SHADOWS            | Cloud shadows                       |
|  **4** | VEGETATION               | Healthy vegetation                  |
|  **5** | NOT_VEGETATED            | Soil / rocks / built-up             |
|  **6** | WATER                    | Water bodies                        |
|  **7** | UNCLASSIFIED             | No classification available         |
|  **8** | CLOUD_MEDIUM_PROBABILITY | Possible clouds (medium confidence) |
|  **9** | CLOUD_HIGH_PROBABILITY   | Highly probable clouds              |
| **10** | THIN_CIRRUS              | High thin cirrus clouds             |
| **11** | SNOW                     | Snow or ice                         |

### SCL classes and handling
- 0  NO_DATA                         → KEEP
- 1  SATURATED_OR_DEFECTIVE          → KEEP
- 2  DARK_FEATURES                   → KEEP
- 3  CLOUD_SHADOWS                   → EXCLUDE
- 4  VEGETATION                      → KEEP
- 5  NOT_VEGETATED (soil/bare)       → KEEP
- 6  WATER                           → EXCLUDE
- 7  UNCLASSIFIED                    → KEEP
- 8  CLOUD_MEDIUM_PROBABILITY        → EXCLUDE
- 9  CLOUD_HIGH_PROBABILITY          → EXCLUDE
- 10 THIN_CIRRUS                     → EXCLUDE
- 11 SNOW_OR_ICE                     → KEEP

Notes:
- If SCL is missing for an item, we skip masking.

### Implementation notes
- SCL is normally 20 m resolution; we *upsample* SCL to 10 m (nearest-neighbor / 2×2 repeat) to align with B04/B08 before masking.
